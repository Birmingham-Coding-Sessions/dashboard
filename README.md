# Dashboard #

This is a coding project from [Birmingham Coding Sessions](http://www.meetup.com/Birmingham-Coding-Sessions).

The idea is to create a dashboard which can show live updates to streams such as:

- Company newsfeed.
- GitHub/Bitbucket commit info.
- Continuous integration server messages.
- Twitter/Facebook/general social media.
etc.
